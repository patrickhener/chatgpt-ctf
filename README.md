# chatgpt-ctf
A little CTF Challenge based on output of ChatGPT. Also read the article at [hesec.de](https://hesec.de/posts/chatgpt-ctf).

## Motivation
As the hype around [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) started rising I was curious if the bot could design a CTF challenge based on `golang`. And sure it did.

This is the result I came up with. Also the code is altered the basis of the challenge was designed by the bot itself.

## Run
To run simply do `docker-compose up`.

It will then give you an interface on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
